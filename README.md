# Apk Crawler
A crawler used to retrieve apps from various Android Stores.
Currently supported are Google Play and F-Droid.
Both require the usage of the [unofficial APIs](https://github.com/NoahMauthe/APIs) which handle all store specific issues to allow for the easy addition of additional markets.

Please note that since these APIs are unofficial and try to reimplement internal APIs, they may stop working unexpectedly due to changes done by one of the markets.
